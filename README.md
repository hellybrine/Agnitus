# Agnitus Project

Agnitus is a system information gathering tool that collects essential data about a Windows machine, such as user information, system info, running processes, network data, and installed programs. The tool is designed to run in administrator mode and can gather a wide range of data useful for system audits, diagnostics, or monitoring purposes.

## Features

- **User Information**: Collects details about the current user and their environment.
- **Process Information**: Gathers a list of currently running processes.
- **Network Information**: Collects network configuration data including IP configuration and network adapters.
- **Installed Programs**: Retrieves a list of installed programs and their versions.
- **System Information**: Collects system details like OS version, build number, and architecture.
- **Environment Variables**: Dumps the environment variables set in the system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agnitus.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd agnitus
   ```

3. Run the batch file:
   ```bash
   agnitus.bat
   ```

   Ensure you run the script as an administrator to allow proper data collection.

## Installation

No installation required, just download the repository and run the script. 

Make sure the following utilities are available on your system:
- `net`
- `tasklist`
- `ipconfig`
- `powershell`

## Features to Be Implemented

- **Encryption of Output Files**: Add the ability to encrypt the output files after they are collected, making them harder to read.
  
- **Scheduled Task**: Implement functionality to schedule the script to run periodically (daily, weekly, etc.) using Windows Task Scheduler.

- **Remote Upload**: After collecting data, upload the results to a remote server via FTP, HTTP, or a cloud service API.

- **File Integrity Check**: Add hash checks (e.g., SHA256) for the output files to ensure they haven’t been tampered with.

- **Log File Creation**: Generate a log file that tracks the script’s execution, timestamps, and any errors encountered.

- **Stealthy Process Execution**: Modify the script to run in the background, hiding the command prompt window during execution. This can be achieved by using a PowerShell command or a VBScript wrapper.

- **Geolocation via External API**: Query an external API to determine the geolocation of the IP address and add this to the collected data.

- **Memory Dump**: Add functionality to dump memory for system diagnostics or to track hidden processes.

- **Hardware Information**: Extend the system information gathering to include hardware data such as CPU temperature, disk usage, RAM usage, etc.

- **Email Notification**: Implement email notification when the script has completed gathering information.
